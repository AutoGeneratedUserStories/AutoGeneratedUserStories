# AutoGeneratedUserStories
356 Project

The main idea of our project is users should be able to auto generate user stories from requirements

Users are able to describe a project and their team and the tool will generate user stories and  acceptance criteria from that

They will be able to view these stories on a dashboard and the stories would have 3 things

1. A title
2. A description of the story
3. Acceptance criteria for that story

The users can also export these stories to another tool such as Jira, Trello or Github Projects
